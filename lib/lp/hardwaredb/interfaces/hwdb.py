# Identification of a hardware device.
#
# In theory, a tuple (bus, vendor ID, product ID) should identify
# a device unambiguously. In practice, there are several cases where
# this tuple can identify more than one device:
#
# - A USB chip or chipset may be used in different devices.
#   A real world example:
#     - Plustek sold different scanner models with the USB ID
#       0x7b3/0x0017. Some of these scanners have for example a
#       different maximum scan size.
#
# Hence we identify a device by tuple (bus, vendor ID, product ID,
# variant). In the example above, we might use (HWBus.USB, '0x7b3',
# '0x0017', 'OpticPro UT12') and (HWBus.USB, '0x7b3', '0x0017',
# 'OpticPro UT16')
