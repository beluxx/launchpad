          To merge two Launchpad accounts:
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>You must be logged in to Launchpad under the account you
            want to keep.</li>
          <li>You must have access to the email address registered
            under the other account that you want to remove.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will receive an email notification requesting you authorize
          the merge, and once you've proven that you own the duplicated
          account's email address, it will be assigned to you, along with
          everything else owned by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If you no longer have access to the duplicated account's
          email address, you may place a
          <a href="/launchpad/+addquestion">support request</a>.
          The Launchpad administrators will tend to your request as soon
          as possible.
