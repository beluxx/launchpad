= Message Holds =

When messages are posted to mailing lists, they may sometimes get held
for team administrator approval.  This happens for example, when the
sender of the message is not a member of the mailing list and their
personal standing in Launchpad is unknown.

    >>> from lp.registry.tests import mailinglists_helper
    >>> team_one, list_one = mailinglists_helper.new_team('test-one', True)

    # We don't care about the email notifications sent when the mailing
    # list was created, and we don't want the notification to confuse
    # things later on in this test, so clear the queue.
    >>> from lp.testing import mail_helpers
    >>> ignore = mail_helpers.pop_notifications()


== Initial hold ==

When the message is initially held for approval, a message object is
first created.

    >>> from lp.services.messages.interfaces.message import IMessageSet
    >>> message_set = getUtility(IMessageSet)
    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My first test
    ... Message-ID: <first-post>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:08:59 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my first post!
    ... """)

Then this message is inserted into the approval queue.

    >>> held_message = list_one.holdMessage(message)
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.mailinglist import IMessageApproval
    >>> verifyObject(IMessageApproval, held_message)
    True

We can get some useful details about this held message by adapting it to the
IHeldMessageDetails interface.

    >>> from zope.component import getAdapter
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.mailinglist import IHeldMessageDetails
    >>> details = getAdapter(held_message, IHeldMessageDetails)
    >>> print details.message_id
    <first-post>
    >>> print details.subject
    My first test
    >>> print details.author.displayname
    Foo Bar
    >>> print details.date
    2000-08-01 01:08:59+00:00

The new hold has several important pieces of information, such as the
message id of the held message...

    >>> print held_message.message_id
    <first-post>

...the person who posted the message...

    >>> print held_message.posted_by.displayname
    Foo Bar

...and the date it was posted.

    >>> print held_message.posted_date
    2000-08-01 01:08:59+00:00

The hold record contains a reference to the mailing list that the
message was posted to....

    >>> print held_message.mailing_list.team.displayname
    Test One

...and to the content of the message in the librarian.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> held_message.posted_message.open()
    >>> try:
    ...     print held_message.posted_message.read()
    ... finally:
    ...     held_message.posted_message.close()
    From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    Subject: My first test
    Message-ID: <first-post>
    Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:08:59 -0000
    <BLANKLINE>
    This is my first post!
    <BLANKLINE>

The record also contains the status of this held message.

    >>> held_message.status
     <DBItem PostedMessageStatus.NEW, (0) New status>

Because this message has not yet been approved, it has no disposition
information.

    >>> print held_message.disposed_by
    None
    >>> print held_message.disposal_date
    None

A notification message is sent to every team administrator informing
them that there is a message waiting for their approval.

    >>> mail_helpers.print_emails()
    From: Test One <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: no-priv@canonical.com
    Subject: New mailing list message requiring approval for Test One
    <BLANKLINE>
    Hello No Privileges Person,
    <BLANKLINE>
    Test One has a new message requiring your approval.
    <BLANKLINE>
        Subject: My first test
        Author name: Foo Bar
        Author url: http://launchpad.dev/~name16
        Date: 2000-08-01 01:08:59+00:00
        Message-ID: <first-post>
    <BLANKLINE>
    A message has been posted to the mailing list for your team, but this
    message requires your approval before it will be sent to the list
    members.  After reviewing the message, you may approve, discard or
    reject it.
    <BLANKLINE>
    To review all messages pending approval, visit:
    <BLANKLINE>
        http://launchpad.dev/~test-one/+mailinglist-moderate
    <BLANKLINE>

    The Launchpad team
    ----------------------------------------


== Approving the message ==

No Privileges Person is the team owner who reviews the held message, and
he decides that it is appropriate for the mailing list, so he approves
it.

    >>> owner = list_one.team.teamowner
    >>> print owner.displayname
    No Privileges Person
    >>> held_message.approve(owner)

This sets the status of the hold to APPROVAL_PENDING because Mailman
still needs to see this approval.

    >>> held_message.status
    <DBItem PostedMessageStatus.APPROVAL_PENDING, (20) Approval pending>

The message has been disposed by Foo Bar on today's date.

    >>> print held_message.disposed_by.displayname
    No Privileges Person
    >>> held_message.disposal_date is not None
    True


== Rejecting the message ==

Held messages can also be rejected, in which case the original message is
bounced back to the sender.

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My second test
    ... Message-ID: <second-post>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:09:00 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my second post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_one.holdMessage(message)
    >>> held_message.reject(owner)

    >>> print held_message.message_id
    <second-post>
    >>> held_message.status
    <DBItem PostedMessageStatus.REJECTION_PENDING, (30) Decline pending>
    >>> print held_message.disposed_by.displayname
    No Privileges Person
    >>> held_message.disposal_date is not None
    True


== Discarding the message ==

Held messages can also be discarded.  Nothing further is done with the
message.

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My third test
    ... Message-ID: <third-post>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:09:00 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my third post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_one.holdMessage(message)
    >>> held_message.discard(owner)

    >>> print held_message.message_id
    <third-post>
    >>> held_message.status
    <DBItem PostedMessageStatus.DISCARD_PENDING, (60) Discard pending>
    >>> print held_message.disposed_by.displayname
    No Privileges Person
    >>> held_message.disposal_date is not None
    True


== Message sets ==

It's convenient to be able to request all of the new messages, or all
messages that are pending approval or rejection.  The
IMessageApprovalSet interface provides these conveniences.

A few more messages are held for approval.

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My fourth test
    ... Message-ID: <fourth-post>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:09:01 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my fourth post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_one.holdMessage(message)

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My fifth test
    ... Message-ID: <fifth-post>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:09:02 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my fifth post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_one.holdMessage(message)

A second mailing list gets created and some messages get held for approval on
that list too.

    >>> team_two, list_two = mailinglists_helper.new_team('test-two', True)

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: test-two@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My sixth test
    ... Message-ID: <sixth-post>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:09:03 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my sixth post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_two.holdMessage(message)

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: test-two@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My seventh test
    ... Message-ID: <seventh-post>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:09:04 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my seventh post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_two.holdMessage(message)

Here are some helper functions.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.mailinglist import IMessageApprovalSet
    >>> hold_set = getUtility(IMessageApprovalSet)
    >>> from operator import attrgetter
    >>> def print_hold(message_hold):
    ...     message_id = message_hold.message_id
    ...     subject = message_hold.message.subject
    ...     list_name = message_hold.mailing_list.team.name
    ...     print message_id, list_name, subject

    >>> def print_messages(status):
    ...     held_messages = sorted(hold_set.getHeldMessagesWithStatus(status))
    ...     for message_id, team_name in held_messages:
    ...         held_message = hold_set.getMessageByMessageID(message_id)
    ...         print_hold(held_message)

Here are all the messages pending approval...

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.mailinglist import PostedMessageStatus
    >>> print_messages(PostedMessageStatus.APPROVAL_PENDING)
    <first-post> test-one My first test

...and all the messages pending rejection...

    >>> print_messages(PostedMessageStatus.REJECTION_PENDING)
    <second-post> test-one My second test

...and all the messages where are waiting for any disposition.

    >>> print_messages(PostedMessageStatus.NEW)
    <fifth-post> test-one My fifth test
    <fourth-post> test-one My fourth test
    <seventh-post> test-two My seventh test
    <sixth-post> test-two My sixth test

When managing the held messages for a mailing lists, we will want to query for
just those new messages needing approval for a specific list.

    >>> for message_hold in list_one.getReviewableMessages():
    ...     print_hold(message_hold)
    <fourth-post> test-one My fourth test
    <fifth-post> test-one My fifth test

    >>> for message_hold in list_two.getReviewableMessages():
    ...     print_hold(message_hold)
    <sixth-post> test-two My sixth test
    <seventh-post> test-two My seventh test


== Non-ASCII hold notifications ==

When a message is sent by a person who's name contains non-ASCII characters,
the notification message is properly encoded.

    # Ignore any notifications up to this point.
    >>> ignore = mail_helpers.pop_notifications()

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: carlos@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: =?iso-8859-1?q?Adi=C3=B3s?=

    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:09:00 -0000
    ...

    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_one.holdMessage(message)

    >>> mail_helpers.print_emails()
    From: Test One <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: no-priv@canonical.com
    Subject: New mailing list message requiring approval for Test One
    Hello No Privileges Person,
    <BLANKLINE>
    Test One has a new message requiring your approval.
    <BLANKLINE>
        Subject: Adi=C3=83=C2=B3s

    A message has been posted to the mailing list for your team, but this
    message requires your approval before it will be sent to the list
    members.  After reviewing the message, you may approve, discard or
    reject it.

    ----------------------------------------


== Posting privileges ==
Message approvals are also used to derived posting privileges for non-team
members.  To start with, only the team owner can post to the list.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> team_three, list_three = mailinglists_helper.new_team(
    ...     'test-three', True)
    >>> sorted(list_three.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'no-priv@canonical.com']

Salgado posts a message to the list, but because he is not a team member, it
gets held for approval.

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: guilherme.salgado@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My first test
    ... Message-ID: <zebra>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:08:59 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my first post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_three.holdMessage(message)
    >>> transaction.commit()

If the message gets discarded (or rejected), Salgado is still not allowed to
post to the mailing list.

    >>> held_message.discard(owner)
    >>> held_message.acknowledge()
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> sorted(list_three.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'no-priv@canonical.com']

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.mailinglist import IMailingListSet
    >>> mailinglist_set = getUtility(IMailingListSet)
    >>> bulk_addresses = mailinglist_set.getSenderAddresses(['test-three'])
    >>> sorted(email for name, email in bulk_addresses['test-three'])
    [u'no-priv@canonical.com']

Salgado posts another message to the list, but this time it's approved.

    >>> message = message_set.fromEmail("""\
    ... From: guilherme.salgado@canonical.com
    ... To: test-one@lists.launchpad.dev
    ... Subject: My first test
    ... Message-ID: <yeti>
    ... Date: Fri, 01 Aug 2000 01:08:59 -0000
    ...
    ... This is my second post!
    ... """)
    >>> held_message = list_three.holdMessage(message)
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> held_message.approve(owner)
    >>> held_message.acknowledge()
    >>> transaction.commit()

Now, Salgado is on the list of approved posters.

    >>> sorted(list_three.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', u'no-priv@canonical.com']

    >>> bulk_addresses = mailinglist_set.getSenderAddresses(['test-three'])
    >>> sorted(email for name, email in bulk_addresses['test-three'])
    [u'guilherme.salgado@canonical.com', u'no-priv@canonical.com']

But he will still not get messages delivered to his address, since he's not
subscribed to the team mailing list.

    >>> sorted(list_three.getSubscribedAddresses())
    []

Of course, Salgado still cannot post to a mailing list that he has not been
approved for, because he has not had three approved moderations.

    >>> team_four, list_four = mailinglists_helper.new_team(
    ...     'test-four', True)
    >>> sorted(list_four.getSenderAddresses())
    [u'no-priv@canonical.com']


== Duplicates ==

When a person responds to a bug email, the message can end up in the database
twice, once as posted from Malone, and once as held by Mailman.

    >>> message_text = """\
    ... From: foo.bar@canonical.com
    ... To: 1@bugs.launchpad.dev
    ... Date: Fri Jun 17 10:20:23 BST 2005
    ... Subject: Firefox 1
    ... Message-ID: <xinu>
    ...
    ... Here is more information on your bug.
    ... """

    # Fake PGP signature.  See bugs-emailinterface.txt for details.
    >>> from email.Message import Message
    >>> class SignedMessage(Message):
    ...     @property
    ...     def signedMessage(self):
    ...         return self
    ...     signature = object()

    >>> from lp.bugs.mail.handler import MaloneHandler
    >>> from email import message_from_string
    >>> malone_msg = message_from_string(message_text, _class=SignedMessage)

    # Tweak the Subject so we can tell the two message apart.
    >>> del malone_msg['subject']
    >>> malone_msg['Subject'] = 'Firefox 2'
    >>> from lp.testing import login, logout
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> MaloneHandler().process(malone_msg, malone_msg['to'])
    True
    >>> transaction.commit()

    # This one will still have Subject: Firefox 1
    >>> list_message = message_set.fromEmail(message_text)
    >>> held_message = list_four.holdMessage(list_message)

The message with the Message-ID <xinu> appears twice in the database.

    >>> for message in sorted(message_set.get('<xinu>'),
    ...                       key=attrgetter('subject')):
    ...     print message.subject, message.rfc822msgid
    Firefox 1 <xinu>
    Firefox 2 <xinu>

But the held message details used in the web u/i's moderation interface gets
only the one held by Mailman.

    >>> details = getAdapter(held_message, IHeldMessageDetails)
    >>> print details.message_id
    <xinu>
    >>> print details.subject
    Firefox 1

    >>> logout()
