"""Test `lp.testing.ZopeTestInSubProcess`.

How does it do this?

A `TestCase`, mixed-in with `ZopeTestInSubProcess`, is run by the Zope
test runner. This test case sets its own layer, to keep track of the
PIDs when certain methods are called. It also records pids for its own
methods. Assertions are made as these methods are called to ensure that
they are running in the correct process - the parent or the child.

Recording of the PIDs is handled using the `record_pid` decorator.

    The assertions for tearDown() and testTearDown() must be done here

    Zope layers. See `TestZopeTestInSubProcess` for its use.
