Access to HWDB tables
=====================

The access to most HWDB tables is restricted to members of the team
"canonical".

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> hwdb_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('hwdb-team')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('no-priv')
    >>> no_priv.inTeam(hwdb_team)
    False
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name12')
    >>> sample_person.inTeam(hwdb_team)
    True

    >>> from zope.security.interfaces import Unauthorized
    >>> def check_authorized_for(obj, attribute, person_name_or_address):
