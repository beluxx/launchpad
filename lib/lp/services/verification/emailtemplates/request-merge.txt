Hello

Launchpad: request to merge accounts
------------------------------------

Someone has asked us to merge one of your Launchpad
accounts with another.

If you go ahead, this will merge the account called
'%(dupename)s' into the account '%(requester)s'.

To confirm you want to do this, please follow
this link:

    %(token_url)s

If you didn't ask to merge these accounts, please
either ignore this email or report it to the
Launchpad team: feedback@launchpad.net

You can read more about merging accounts in our
help wiki:

Thank you,

The Launchpad team
