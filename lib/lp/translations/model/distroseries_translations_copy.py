    """Furnish untranslated child `DistroSeries` with previous series's
    translations.

    This method uses `MultiTableCopy` to copy data.

    Translation data for the new series ("child") is first copied into holding
    tables called e.g. "temp_POTemplate_holding_ubuntu_feisty" and processed
    there.  Then, near the end of the procedure, the contents of these holding
    tables are all poured back into the original tables.

    If this procedure fails, it may leave holding tables behind.  This was
    done deliberately to leave some forensics information for failures, and
    also to allow admins to see what data has and has not been copied.

    If a holding table left behind by an abortive run has a column called
    new_id at the end, it contains unfinished data and may as well be dropped.
    If it does not have that column, the holding table was already in the
    process of being poured back into its source table.  In that case the
    sensible thing to do is probably to continue pouring it.

    # distroseries without any existing translations attached, it can afford
    # to be much more cavalier with ACID considerations than the function that
    # updates an existing translation based on what's found in the previous
    # series.

    # 1. Extraction phase--for every table involved (called a "source table"
    # in MultiTableCopy parlance), we create a "holding table."  We fill that
    # with all rows from the source table that we want to copy from the
    # previous series.  We make some changes to the copied rows, such as
    # making them belong to ourselves instead of our previous series.
    #
    # The first phase does not modify any tables that other clients may want
    # to use, avoiding locking problems.
    #
    # 2. Pouring phase.  From each holding table we pour all rows back into
    # the matching source table, deleting them from the holding table as we
    # go.  The holding table is dropped once empty.
    #
    # The second phase is "batched," moving only a small number of rows at a
    # time, then performing an intermediate commit.  This avoids holding too
    # many locks for too long and disrupting regular database service.
