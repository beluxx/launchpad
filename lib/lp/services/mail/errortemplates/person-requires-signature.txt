Launchpad only accepts signed email from your address.

If you want to use the Launchpad email interface, you will need to go here
to import your OpenPGP key and then use it to sign your messages:

  %(import_url)s

If you did not knowingly send email to Launchpad, then spammers may be
forging messages as if they were sent from your address, perhaps due to
a compromised address book, and you can safely ignore this message.
