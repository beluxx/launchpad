POFileBaseView
==============

POFileBaseView provides different basic information about a POFile and a list
of its content as TranslatableMessage objects.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> from lp.translations.browser.pofile import POFileBaseView

    >>> potemplate = factory.makePOTemplate()
    >>> pofile = factory.makePOFile('eo', potemplate)

    >>> view = POFileBaseView(pofile, LaunchpadTestRequest())
    >>> view.initialize()

The view provides a statement to be displayed to the user about the
permissions the user has on the POFile. When not logged in, the user cannot
work on translations.

    >>> print view.permission_statement
    You are not logged in.  Please log in to work on translations.

So we'd better log in.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> view = POFileBaseView(pofile, LaunchpadTestRequest())
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print view.permission_statement
    You have full access to this translation.

The view also provides more detailed information about what the user can do.

    >>> print view.user_can_edit
    True
    >>> print view.user_can_suggest
    True

The view has information about the languages plural forms:

    >>> print view.number_of_plural_forms
    2
    >>> print view.plural_expression
    n != 1

The view also know about the contributers to the translations in this POFile
but currently there have not been any contributions yet.

    >>> print view.contributors
    ()

So let's make a contribution.

    >>> contributor = factory.makePerson(displayname="Contri Butor")
    >>> potmsgset = factory.makePOTMsgSet(potemplate, sequence=1)
    >>> translation = factory.makeCurrentTranslationMessage(pofile, potmsgset,
    ...     translator=contributor, reviewer=contributor,
    ...     translations=['A translation made by a contributor.'])
    >>> view = POFileBaseView(pofile, LaunchpadTestRequest())
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print view.contributors[0].displayname
    Contri Butor

The view has a list of all translations.

    >>> print view.messages[0].getCurrentTranslation().msgstr0.translation
    A translation made by a contributor.

The view can also tell us about the translation group but the pofile is not
yet managed by a translation group.

    >>> print view.translation_group
    None

The view makes a nice statement about this fact, too.

    >>> print view.translation_groups_statement
    No translation group has been assigned.

So let's create one and let it manage the translations.

    >>> group = factory.makeTranslationGroup(title="Test Translators")
    >>> potemplate.product.translationgroup = group
    >>> view = POFileBaseView(pofile, LaunchpadTestRequest())
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print view.translation_group.title
    Test Translators

Who is assigned to do translations into this language? Nobody so far.

    >>> print view.translator
    None

Let's change that. A single person can be a tanslator

    >>> translator = factory.makeTranslator('eo', group, contributor)
    >>> view = POFileBaseView(pofile, LaunchpadTestRequest())
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> print view.translator.displayname
    Contri Butor

See what statement the view makes now.

    >>> print view.translation_groups_statement
    This translation is managed by Contri Butor assigned by Test Translators.

Neither the group nor the translator have managed to setup some documentation.

    >>> view.has_any_documentation
    False

But now the group finally got around to it.

    >>> group.translation_guide_url = "https://launchpad.net/"
    >>> view = POFileBaseView(pofile, LaunchpadTestRequest())
    >>> view.initialize()
    >>> view.has_any_documentation
    True
