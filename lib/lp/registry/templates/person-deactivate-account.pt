          Deactivating your account will remove your Launchpad profile and
          permanently delete all of your:
        </p>

        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>bug, blueprint, question, and code subscriptions</li>
          <li>bug and blueprint assignments</li>
          <li>
            team memberships - ownership of teams, projects, and project
            groups will be reassigned to the Registry Administrators team
          </li>
          <li>Code of Conduct signatures</li>
          <li>assignments as bug contact for packages</li>
          <li>assignments as answer contact for projects or distributions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You will still be credited for any work that you have done that is
          recorded in Launchpad.  For example, if you reported a bug, you
          will still be shown as its reporter.  If you do not want your
          personal details associated with this work, then you should
          <a tal:attributes="href string:${context/fmt:url}/+edit">change
          your account details</a> first to remove any identifying
          information.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you deactivate your account, you will not receive any further
          emails from us.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you later decide that you want to start using Launchpad again,
          you can reactivate your account by <a href="/+login">signing
          up</a> again using one of the email addresses from your
          deactivated account.  (We store these email addresses to ensure
          that only the original owner of an account can reactivate it, and
          for no other purpose; they are never shown to other Launchpad
          users.)  Reactivating an account will not restore any information
          that was deleted when you deactivated it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to keep your Launchpad account but would prefer to
          reduce the amount of email you receive, try removing your
          <a tal:attributes="
            href string:${context/fmt:url}/+subscribedbugs">bug
            subscriptions</a>
          and

            subscriptions</a>.

          If you want to reduce the amount of information about you in
          Launchpad, you can

          your account details</a>.
