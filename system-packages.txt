# System-installed Python packages to link into our virtualenv.  This
# facility should be reserved for cases where installing them as a normal
# Python dependency is impossible or unreliable (perhaps due to frequent ABI
# changes in system libraries they depend on, or frequent security updates
# managed by the distribution's security team).
