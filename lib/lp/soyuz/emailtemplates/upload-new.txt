%(CHANGESFILE)s


Your package contains new components which requires manual editing of
the override file.  It is ok otherwise, so please be patient.  New
packages are usually added to the overrides about once a week.

You may have gotten the distroseries wrong.  If so, you may get warnings
above if files already exist in other distroseries.
