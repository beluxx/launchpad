= Deleting bug attachments =

If some attachment gets added which isn't relevant to the bug, it can be
deleted again from the bug attachment edit page.

    >>> from io import BytesIO
    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.test/bugs/2')
    >>> user_browser.open(user_browser.url + '/+addcomment')
    >>> foo_file = BytesIO(b'V1agra.')
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Attachment').add_file(
    ...   foo_file, 'text/plain', 'foo.txt')
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Description').value = 'Great deal'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Post Comment').click()

The attachment is now visible on the bug page.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.test/bugs/2')
    >>> attachment_portlet = find_portlet(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'Bug attachments')
    >>> for li in attachment_portlet.findAll('li', 'download-attachment'):
    ...     print(li.a.renderContents())
    Great deal

There will also be a comment with a link to the attachment in its body.

    >>> print_comments(user_browser.contents)
    <p>This would be a real killer feature...</p>
    ----------------------------------------
    <p>Oddly enough the bug system seems only capable...</p>
    ----------------------------------------
    Attachment: Great deal
    <BLANKLINE>
    ----------------------------------------

If we go to the attachment edit page, there's an option to delete the
attachment.

    >>> import re
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url=re.compile(r'[+]attachment/\d+$')).click()
    >>> print(user_browser.title)
    Bug #2...
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Delete Attachment') is not None
    True

If the button is pressed, the attachment will be deleted, which means
that it won't show up in the attachments portlet anymore. Since there
arent' any other attachments, the portlet won't show up at all.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Delete Attachment').click()
    >>> user_browser.url
    'http://.../+bug/2'
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(user_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print(message.renderContents())
    Attachment
    "<a href="http://bugs.launchpad.test/...+files/foo.txt">Great deal</a>"
    has been deleted.

    >>> print(find_portlet(user_browser.contents, 'Bug attachments'))
    None

Since the attachment has been deleted, the comment referencing it will no
longer be visible.

    >>> print_comments(user_browser.contents)
    <p>This would be a real killer feature...</p>
    ----------------------------------------
    <p>Oddly enough the bug system seems only capable...</p>

XXX Abel Deuring, 2009-11-25: We should check here that attempts to
access the Librarian file for the deleted bug attachment do indeed
result in a 404 error, in order to avoid future misunderstandings
about the Librarian file deletion process as described in bug 387188.
Unfortunately, this is at present not possible, see bug 113083.
