"""Retrying build in MANUALDEPWAIT state.

This procedure aims to retry builds in all supported series and architectures
in the given distribution which have failed due to unsatisfied
build-dependencies.

It checks every build in this state, including PPA and PARTNER ones, and
retries the ones which got their dependencies published after they were tried.

Unlike the other buildd-cronscripts, this one it targeted to run via cron
in parallel with other tasks happening in build farm.

As an optimization, distroseries from the selected distribution which are not
supported anymore (OBSOLETE status) are skipped.
