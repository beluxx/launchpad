"""The processing of nascent uploads.

Documentation on general design
  - want to log all possible errors to the end-user
  - changes file holds all uploaded files in a tree
  - changes.files and changes.dsc
  - DSC represents a source upload, and creates sources
  - but DSC holds DSCUploadedFiles, weirdly
  - binary represents a binary upload, and creates binaries
  - source files only exist for verify() purposes
  - NascentUpload is a motor that creates the changes file, does
    verifications, gets overrides, triggers creation or rejection and
    prepares the email message
