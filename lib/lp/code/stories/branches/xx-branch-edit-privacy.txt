Changing branch privacy
=======================

Which users can have private branches is controlled by
the branch visibility policy (see doc/branch-visibility-policy.txt).
This controls the initial visibility of branches created by users
in particular namespaces, either their own or teams that the user is
a member of.

Once the branch is created, the user is able to change a public branch
to private or a private branch to public in certain circumstances.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> eric = factory.makePerson(
    ...     name='eric', displayname='Eric the Viking',
    ...     email='eric@example.com')
    >>> fooix = factory.makeProduct(
    ...     name='fooix', displayname='Fooix', owner=eric)
    >>> trunk = factory.makeProductBranch(
    ...     owner=eric, product=fooix, name='trunk')
    >>> logout()


Branches with no visibility policy
----------------------------------

If there is no policy set, then the user is not able to change the visibility
of the branch.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic eric@example.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~eric/fooix/trunk')
    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: label 'Keep branch confidential'

However an admin can.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~eric/fooix/trunk')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()

The branch is now private, so it assumes the standard private presentation.

    >>> print_tag_with_id(admin_browser.contents, 'privacy')
    This branch is private


Private branches allowed
------------------------

Allow the Warty Security Team to have private firefox branches.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+branchvisibility')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Customise policy for Mozilla Firefox').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Team', index=0).value = 'name20'
    >>> print_radio_button_field(admin_browser.contents, 'rule')
    ( ) Public
    (*) Private
    ( ) Private only
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Set Team Policy').click()

Now Sample Person, who is a member of the Warty Security Team should be
able to mark the branch as private.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://code.launchpad.dev/~name12/firefox/main')
    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()

A notification is added to say the branch is now private.

    >>> print_feedback_messages(browser.contents)
    The branch is now private, and only visible to the owner and to subscribers.

Since the branch is now private, it will have the standard Launchpad
presentation for private things.

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'privacy'))
    This branch is private

If Sample Person changes the branch from private back to public, the page
reverts to its normal presentation.

    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential').selected = False
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'privacy'))
    This branch is public

A notification is added to say the branch is now public.

    >>> print_feedback_messages(browser.contents)
    The branch is now publicly accessible.


Private Only branches
---------------------

If the policy specifies private only, then the user is able to make
a public branch private, but not vice versa.

    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Set policy for a team').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Set Default Forbidden').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Set policy for a team').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Team', index=0).value = 'name20'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Private only').click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Set Team Policy').click()

Mark the public branch private.

    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()

The branch is now private, so it assumes the standard private presentation.

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'privacy'))
    This branch is private

However when the user now looks to edit the branch details, there
is no option to mark the branch as public.

    >>> browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('Keep branch confidential')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: label 'Keep branch confidential'


Branches stacked on private branches
------------------------------------

A public branch is private if it is stacked on a private branch. When the
branch is edited, it is shown as private but the checkbox widget is disabled
and the title and hint text is updated to inform the user.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> stacked_on_branch = factory.makeAnyBranch(private=True)
    >>> stacked_branch = factory.makeAnyBranch(stacked_on=stacked_on_branch)
    >>> url = canonical_url(stacked_branch)
    >>> logout()

    >>> admin_browser.open(url)
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Change branch details').click()
    >>> privacy_checkbox = admin_browser.getControl('Branch is confidential')
    >>> print privacy_checkbox.selected
    True
    >>> print privacy_checkbox.disabled
    True
    >>> ('branch is confidential because it is stacked on a private branch'
    ...  in admin_browser.contents)
    True

If the branch is edited and saved, there is no user message displayed since
the transitive privacy status hasn't changed.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Description').value = "New changes"
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change Branch').click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(browser.contents)
    ...
