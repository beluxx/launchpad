Attempting to post a mailing list subscription request to a team that has no list
is thwarted by the view because it strips the checkbox from the form.
Therefore no error message is seen.

    >>> sample_person = personset.getByName('name12')
    >>> login_person(sample_person)
    >>> no_list_team = make_team(
    ...     'open-team-no-list', TeamSubscriptionPolicy.OPEN)

    >>> join_team(no_list_team)
    You have successfully joined open-team-no-list.

Someone subscribing to a moderated team's list will be shown an
informative message regarding the delayed subscription.

    >>> moderated_team = make_team(
    ...     'moderated-team-with-list',
    ...     TeamSubscriptionPolicy.MODERATED)
    >>> moderated_list = new_list_for_team(moderated_team)

    >>> join_team(moderated_team)
    Your request to join moderated-team-with-list is awaiting approval.
    Your mailing list subscription is awaiting approval.

    >>> sorted(moderated_list.getSubscribedAddresses())
    []

    # The subscription object is in the database, waiting for the
    # team membership approval.
    >>> moderated_list.getSubscription(sample_person)
    <MailingListSubscription ...>

Users joining an open team will be immediately subscribed to the
team's list.

    >>> open_team = make_team(
    ...     'open-team-with-list', TeamSubscriptionPolicy.OPEN)
    >>> open_list = new_list_for_team(open_team)

    >>> join_team(open_team)
    You have successfully joined open-team-with-list.
    You have been subscribed to this team&#x2019;s mailing list.

    >>> sorted(open_list.getSubscribedAddresses())
    [u'test@canonical.com']
