= Email notifications =

Notifications about changes to a mailing list's status are sent out
via email.

    >>> from lp.services.mail import stub
    >>> from lp.testing.mail_helpers import (
    ...     pop_notifications, print_emails)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('salgado')

    >>> from lp.registry.tests.mailinglists_helper import (
    ...     new_team, new_list_for_team)

    # login() as an admin so that we can call IPerson.join() on any
    # person/team we want.
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

When a new email list becomes active, an email notification is sent to
all active team members.

    >>> team_one = new_team('team-one', with_list=False)
    >>> anne = factory.makePersonByName('Anne')
    >>> anne.join(team_one)

    # Clear out the team-membership status emails.
    >>> pop_notifications()
    [...]

    # This will take our team through the entire list creation
    # process, generating notification emails along the way.
    >>> list_one = new_list_for_team(team_one)
    >>> list_one.status.name
    'ACTIVE'

    # Send the emails.
    >>> transaction.commit()

Both Anne and No Privileges Person receive the notifications, Anne as a
newly subscribed member and No Privileges Person as the owner of the
team.

That notification is also sent to the individual members of all
sub-teams.  If a sub-team has a primary contact email address, that
address will be ignored, and the message will be sent to the
individual team members.
