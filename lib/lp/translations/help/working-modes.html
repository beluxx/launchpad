    <h1>Switching between "translator" and "reviewer" modes</h1>

    <p>
      If you're making translations for a project that uses a <em>Structured
      </em> or <em>Restricted</em>
      <a href="/+help-translations/permissions-policies.html">permissions
      policy</a> <strong>and</strong> you're a member of the appropriate
      <a href="/+help-translations/translation-groups.html">translation
      team</a> you can work in one of two modes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Reviewer:</strong> This is the default working mode. All
        changes you make are approved automatically. If you want to make a
        suggestion, rather than a new translation, you need to manually select
        the <em>Someone should to review this translation</em> check-box.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Translator:</strong> When entering new translations, they're
        treated as suggestions that someone else needs to review. You can make
        a direct translation by deselecting the <em>Someone should to review
        this translation</em> check-box.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How this affects team workflows</h2>

    <p>
      When you're reviewing translations made by other people, or you're
      working in a small team, you usually want your translations to be applied
      automatically. This is when you'd choose <em>Reviewer</em> mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you're working in a team that uses a peer review process
      <em>Translator</em> mode will be more suitable as it holds each of your
      translations as suggestions that should be reviewed by someone else.
