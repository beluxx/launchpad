Hello %(user_displayname)s,

You recently stated that you don't know the licence of the project
'%(product_name)s' in Launchpad.

It's important that you find out what this licence is soon, so that
other users understand the terms that the projects is distributed under.
You can do this by following the 'Change Details' link on your project's
overview page.

Launchpad is a collaboration site, free to use for projects with an
approved open source licence.  When you registered your project, you'd
have seen a list of licences presented. These are the licences we
automatically recognise.

If you have a different licence to one on the approved list, it must
follow the guidelines we list on the following page in order to be
approved: https://help.launchpad.net/Legal/ProjectLicensing

Want to know more?
Further information is on our FAQ "Can closed-source or proprietary
projects use Launchpad?" The link is here:
https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+faq/208

If your project's licensing does not meet the guidelines, it will be
marked "Proprietary".  Proprietary projects can only use Launchpad with
prior approval from Canonical.

The Launchpad team.
