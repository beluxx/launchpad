        If you want the results ordered, you have to explicitly specify an
        <orderBy>. Otherwise the order used is not predictable.
        <orderBy> can be either a string with the column name you want to sort
        or a list of column names as strings.

        The <user> parameter is necessary to make sure we don't return any
        bugtask of a private bug for which the user is not subscribed. If
        <user> is None, no private bugtasks will be returned.
